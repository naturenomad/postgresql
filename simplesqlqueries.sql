-- This category deals with the basics of SQL. It covers select and where clauses, case expressions, unions, and a few other odds and ends. 

-- Retrieve everything from a table
select * from cd.facilities;

-- Retrieve specific columns from a table
select name, membercost from cd.facilities;

-- Control which rows are retrieved
select * from cd.facilities where membercost > 0;

-- Control which rows are retrieved - part 2
select facid, name, membercost, monthlymaintenance 
from cd.facilities where membercost > 0 and membercost < (monthlymaintenance/50);

-- Basic string searches
select * from cd.facilities where name like '%Tennis%';

-- Matching against multiple possible values
select * from cd.facilities where facid in (1,5);

-- Classify results into buckets
select name, 
    case 
        when (monthlymaintenance > 100) then 'expensive'
        else 'cheap'
    end as cost
from cd.facilities;

-- Working with dates
select memid, surname, firstname, joindate from cd.members
where joindate >= '2012-09-01';

-- Removing duplicates, and ordering results
select distinct(surname) from cd.members order by surname limit 10;

-- Combining results from multiple queries
select surname from cd.members
union
select name from cd.facilities;

-- Simple aggregation
select max(joindate) from cd.members;

-- More aggregation
select firstname, surname, joindate from cd.members
where joindate=(select max(joindate) from cd.members);
